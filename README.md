# Description
This project aims to implement a Binary Expression Tree in Java, capable of evaluating arithmetic expressions in infix notation. The system allows users to input arithmetic expressions and interactively perform operations, using the binary tree structure to represent the expression and calculate the result.

This implementation fulfills the requirements for the Data Structures II course, covering key concepts such as binary trees, stacks, and linked lists.

# Features
The program has an interactive menu with the following options:

1. Input arithmetic expression in infix notation.
2. Create binary expression tree from the provided input expression.
3. Display the binary expression tree in three traversals: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.
4. Evaluate the expression by traversing the tree and calculating the result.
5. Exit the program.
