# Description
This project aims to implement a Binary Expression Tree in Java, capable of evaluating arithmetic expressions in infix notation. The system allows users to input arithmetic expressions and interactively perform operations, using the binary tree structure to represent the expression and calculate the result.

This implementation fulfills the requirements for the Data Structures II course, covering key concepts such as binary trees, stacks, and linked lists.
